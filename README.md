# Face-Recognition

This repository contains face recognition model using deep learning. 
Specifically, it uses a kind of matching network, FaceNet.
FaceNet: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf)

For simplicity, this model uses open pre-trained models of FaceNet. It consists of Inception Modules.

## Requirements.
Keras 
Tensorflow
OpenCV
